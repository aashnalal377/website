      <description>Matching and Filtering Strings
RegEx (Regular Expression) can be used to search for patterns within a string. This is useful in a variety of contexts, such as matching IP addresses, websites, and nucleotide bases as just a few examples.
In the following string (from Homework 11), I am going to match all of the website addresses.
import re string6=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;http://www.classmates.com/go/e/200988231/CC123101BT/CM00&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/spacer.gif&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/sp \ You have received this email because the requester specified you as their Manager.</description>

      <description>Homelessness and Mental Health Care Accessibility in California and New York
The datasets I chose to explore with this project address homelessness statistics and mental health accessibility statistics in various counties of California and New York. The homelessness dataset includes the total number of homeless individuals in the county along with a breakdown of various subgroups of homeless individuals within that total number. The mental health dataset provides statistics on the number of mental health providers in the county, along with the ratio of residents to mental health providers.</description>

      <description>EDA Project 2: 2016 Election Results by State
The dataset I chose explores the 2016 presidential election results by state, comparing various factors across each state. The binary variable, TrumpWin, expresses 1 if President Trump won in that state is 0 if he did not. State and Abr specify which state we are looking at and Income shows the per capita income in the state. HS, BA, and Adv shows the percent of high school grads, college grads, and advanced degrees respectively.</description>
