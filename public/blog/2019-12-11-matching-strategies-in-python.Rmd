**Matching and Filtering Strings**

RegEx (Regular Expression) can be used to search for patterns within a string. This is useful in a variety of contexts, such as matching IP addresses, websites, and nucleotide bases as just a few examples. 

In the following string (from Homework 11), I am going to match all of the website addresses.
```{python}
import re

re.findall(r'(http://?[^\s]+)',string6)
```

In a new string of nucleotide bases, we can count the number of each of the four bases that appear- the result shows that the A base is the most common and G is the least common. We can also look for a specific sequence. For example, we can find all the times that TTC appears. RegEx can be helpful in this string when searching for a specific binding sequence for a protein or simply looking for patterns in the sequence.
```{python}
string7="ATGGCAATAACCCCCCGTTTCTACTTCTAGAGGAGAAAAGTATTGACATGAGCGCTCCCGGCACAAGGGCCAAAGAAGTCTCCAATTTCTTATTTCCGAATGACATGCGTCTCCTTGCGGGTAAATCACCGACCGCAATTCATAGAAGCCTGGGGGAACAGATAGGTCTAATTAGCTTAAGAGAGTAAATCCTGGGATCATTCAGTAGTAACCATAAACTTACGCTGGGGCTTCTTCGGCGGATTTTTACAGTTACCAACCAGGAGATTTGAAGTAAATCAGTTGAGGATTTAGCCGCGCTATCCGGTAATCTCCAAATTAAAACATACCGTTCCATGAAGGCTAGAATTACTTACCGGCCTTTTCCATGCCTGCGCTATACCCCCCCACTCTCCCGCTTATCCGTCCGAGCGGAGGCAGTGCGATCCTCCGTTAAGATATTCTTACGTGTGACGTAGCTATGTATTTTGCAGAGCTGGCGAACGCGTTGAACACTTCACAGATGGTAGGGATTCGGGTAAAGGGCGTATAATTGGGGACTAACATAGGCGTAGACTACGATGGCGCCAACTCAATCGCAGCTCGAGCGCCCTGAATAACGTACTCATCTCAACTCATTCTCGGCAATCTACCGAGCGACTCGATTATCAACGGCTGTCTAGCAGTTCTAATCTTTTGCCAGCATCGTAATAGCCTCCAAGAGATTGATGATAGCTATCGGCACAGAACTGAGACGGCGCCGATGGATAGCGGACTTTCGGTCAACCACAATTCCCCACGGGACAGGTCCTGCGGTGCGCATCACTCTGAATGTACAAGCAA"

counts = {}
for c in string7:
    if c in counts:
        counts[c]+=1
    else:
        counts[c]=1
        
for c in counts:
 print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
 
re.findall(r'TTC',string7)
```

There are a variety of other ways that RegEx can be used. Re.split can be used to split a string into a list of words, re.match can return only the first match in the string, and re.sub can substitute matches. In the example below, I substitute all T bases in the string with U (uridine).

```{python}
string8="ATGGCAATAACCCCCCGTTTCTACTTCTAGAGGAGAAAAGTATTGACATGAGCGCTCCCGGCACAAGGGCCAAAGAAGTCTCCAATTTCTTATTTCCGAATGACATGCGTCTCCTTGCGGGTAAATCACCGACCGCAATTCATAA"

re.sub(r"T","U",string8)
```
